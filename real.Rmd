## Me!

## Background

- Many, many packages
- Long-time R/C++ dev
- sometimes competent

# What is this?

## Speedups for your speedups

- Ways of making your C++ _even faster and more reliable_
- Assumes some Rcpp knowledge
- Standard C++, _not_ Rcpp

## Rejected titles

- A Benchmark Too Far
- Honey I Shrunk the Runtime
- POINTER DEREFERENCING! The Musical

# Vectors and Deques

## Vectors

- C++ has vectors, just like R (and Rcpp!)
- Everyone uses them

## And then bad stuff happens

```{Rcpp, eval=FALSE}

std::vector < std::string > uh_oh;

for(unsigned int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++){
	
	uh_oh.push_back("noooooo*gurgle**gurgle**dies*");
	
}

```

- Vectors are contiguous - and so expanding them is expensive.
- Appending expands them.

## Solution 1: preallocation!

- If you know the ultimate length of a vector: preallocate.
- One allocation for 1m elements instead of 1m allocations.

```{Rcpp, eval=FALSE}

int input_size = 1000000;

std::vector < std::string > preallocated_vector(vector_size);

for(unsigned int i = 0; i < input_size; i++){
	
	preallocated_vector[i] = "Watch us fly!";
	
}

```

## Solution 2: Deques!
- If you don't know the ultimate length, use deques
- Non-contiguous memory - cheaper to append to
- Still slower than preallocation

```{Rcpp, eval=FALSE}

int input_size = 1000000;

std::deque < std::string > a_deque;

for(unsigned int i = 0; i < input_size; i++){
	
	a_deque.push_back("This works pretty well");
	
}

```

## Final proof

- 1m inserts to:
-- Preallocated vector
-- Non-allocated vector
-- Non-allocated deque
- Result:

# Pointers and References


## Pointers

- In C++ you can pass a 'pointer' instead of a value
- The pointer 'points' to the value
- Modify the pointer? Modifies the value!

```

int* pointer;
int value, value2;

pointer = &value;

*pointer = 10; // value is 10

pointer = &value2;

*pointer = 10; // value2 is 10

```

## Pointer pointers

- Pointers can be NULL, and then everything breaks
- Confusing awful syntax
- No.
- No No.

## References!

- Similar to pointers
- Only one possible value
- Can't be NULL
- Less eyeball-searing syntax

```

int value, value2;

int& reference = value;

reference = 10; // value is 10

int& reference2 = value2;

reference2 = 10; // value2 is 10

```

## Use one, Prefer References

- Passing by reference/pointer > passing object (mostly)
- References are safer
- Edge case: if you need it to be null maybe

# Operators


## Operator choice matters
- As well as `+`, `=`, `*`, etc, etc, C++ has `+=`, `-=`, `*=`.
- Use these wherever possible

```{rcpp}
int x = 1;

// Less efficient
x = (x + 10);

// More efficient!
x += 10;
```

## Eh?

# Misc

## General principles

- Pick containers judiciously
- Never make a new object when you don't have to
- Don't compromise readability

## Other ideas

Things I couldn't fit in but might be useful:

- Other standard containers
- Function inlining (and use)
- Switches versus conditionals

Google has them (or, grab me after my talk!)
